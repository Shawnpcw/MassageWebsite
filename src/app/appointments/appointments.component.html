                        <h3>Relaxation Massage</h3>
                        <p>Relaxation massage, which is the same as a Swedish massage, 
                            has many benefits when it comes to stress, immune system, relaxation, and all
                            around reboosting your body back to its homotosis state. Relaxation massage 
                            helps with stress because it can lower your heart rate and reduce levels of 
                            insulin and cortisol which helps boost your immune system. The massage techniques 
                            that go along promote the body’s outer tissue to promote relaxation of the mind 
                            and body. Relaxation massage also releases your body’s hormones that are 
                            responsible for your overall well-being, dopamine and serotonin, which kick 
                            your brain back into high gear. When it comes to relaxation massage, the reason 
                            to choose it is if you need to reset your self. If you are having pain then you
                            should choose treatment massage. </p>
